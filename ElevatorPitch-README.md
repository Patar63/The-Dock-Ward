# Game Summary
The Dock Ward by Delta Interactive is a 2.5D puzzle platforming game. The art and music style of the game is meant to call back to the old black and white style used in 1920's and 1930's era gangaster and detective films/shows. It uses many different puzzle mechanics to require that a player carefully think about the environment they're in, so that they are able to make steady progress through the levels.
# Call To Action
This semester our main goals are to:
- Improve upon the graphics to make the game look better
- Use new algorithms and math formulas to improve the physics and collision detection within the 3D envrionment
- Redesign some of our levels so that they communicate the game's main functionality more clearly
- Study the target market demographic to better understand how to market our game
- better impliment post processing effects to add film grain style effects to better represent the old movies we take inspiration from
