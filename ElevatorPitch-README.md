# Game Summary
The Dock Ward by Delta Interactive is a 2.5D puzzle platforming game. The art and music style of the game is meant to call back to the old black and white style used in 1920's and 1930's era gangaster and detective films/shows. It uses many different puzzle mechanics to require that a player carefully think about the environment they're in, so that they are able to make steady progress through the levels.
